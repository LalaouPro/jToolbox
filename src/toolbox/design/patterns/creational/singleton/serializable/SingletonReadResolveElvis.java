/**
 * <p>
 * Singleton. Restricts the instantiation of a class to one object.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Through the serializable tools, someone can write a singleton instance to
 * disk, and then read it back up, effectively getting a new instance. Even
 * though the singleton pattern dictates the constructor to be private, the
 * serializable tools have special access to create instances of a class
 * regardless. Thus, in order to maintain the uniqueness of the instance, we
 * exploit a special hook serialization has; a private method on the class
 * being instantiated called {@code readResolve()}, which is meant to supply a
 * "hook" for a class developer to ensure that they have a say in what
 * object is returned by serialization. Oddly enough, readResolve() is not
 * static, but is instead invoked on the new instance just created by the
 * serialization.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This approach has a flaw which makes it potentially non-singleton. Joshua
 * Bloch explained this problem in his Effective Java Reloaded talk at Google
 * I/O 2008. {@code SingletonReadResolveElvis} has a non-transient field
 * (namelly favouriteSongs). A cleverly crafted attack can save reference to
 * deserialized {@code SingletonReadResolveElvis} instance when this field is
 * deserialized (you can see the <i>Elvis</i> stealer). {@code readResolve()}
 * works only if all fields are transient.

     * object reference types must be declared transient. Otherwise, it is

     * technique that is vaguely similar to the MutablePeriod attack in Item 76
     * of Joshua Bloch's presentation in Google I/O 2008. The attack is a bit
     * complicated, but the underlying idea is simple. If a singleton contains a
     * non-transient object reference field, the contents of this field will be
     * deserialized before the singletonâ€™s readResolve method is run.
     * This allows a carefully crafted stream to "steal" a reference to the
     * originally deserialized singleton at the time the contents of the object
     * reference field are deserialized.
